# AI-Valorant
Hello I want to create an artificial intelligence from nothing for valorant. Help me in my journey!
# What I already have.
I already have a system for the input ( An numpy array of the screen ), an output system ( using pyautogui ), a round win/loose system using ocr that can reward or punish the AI.
# What I need.
A way to train and create a weight file cause the code I have have fucked up code generated by ChatGPT and I do not know anything about tensorflow 
and the ways I can input an numpy array for it to return me keys and mouse mouvements to do.
# Why do you want to help me.
It would be so fucking sick to have an AI play valorant. Also I'm 14 y/o.
